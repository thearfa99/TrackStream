# TrackStream
TrackStream is a project management tool modeled after Jira and Trello.
This tool featured task management, user authentication, real-time updates, and automated notifications.
This experience sharpened my skills in full-stack development, API integration, and UI design.

### React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas and Tailwind CSS.
